# Image Enhancement for Mission-Critical Applications

This Python project enhances images to improve clarity and detail, crucial for defense, surveillance, and biometric identification missions. Using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques, it transforms raw, noisy images into clear, actionable visuals.

## Purpose

In high-stakes environments such as military operations and security systems, image quality can directly impact decision-making and operational success. Enhanced images help in:

- Detecting threats in surveillance footage
- Improving accuracy of facial recognition and biometric systems
- Analyzing thermal or night-vision imagery with higher precision

## How the Code Works

1. **Load Raw Images:** Images captured from cameras or sensors are loaded from the dataset folder.
2. **Preprocessing:** The images are resized, normalized, and prepared for model input to ensure consistent processing.
3. **Image Enhancement Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) or other trained model is applied to remove noise, sharpen edges, and improve contrast.
4. **Postprocessing:** The enhanced output is converted back to standard image format and saved in the results folder.
5. **Evaluation:** Quantitative metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) are calculated to measure enhancement quality.
6. **Visualization:** Side-by-side comparisons help verify improvements and support further analysis.
